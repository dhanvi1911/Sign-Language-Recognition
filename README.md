Sign Language Recognition

The project aims at building a machine learning model that will be able to classify the various hand gestures used for fingerspelling in sign language. In this user independent model, classification machine learning algorithms are trained using a set of image data. For the image dataset, depth images are used, which gave better results than some of the previous literatures, owing to the reduced pre-processing time. The machine learning algorithm applied on the datasets is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
